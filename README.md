# @ue-claude/scaffold

Run Claude Code autonomously against Unreal Engine projects. Human authors the plan, container executes it end-to-end,
message board provides live inspectability.

## What Problems Does This Setup Solve?

**1. UBT is a singleton — and agents don't handle that gracefully.**
Unreal Build Tool cannot run concurrently. When an autonomous agent hits a build failure because another build is
already
running, it doesn't queue up and wait — it spirals, retries blindly, or gives up. This scaffold wraps UBT access in a
coordination server with a proper mutex and message board. Agents submit build requests, the server serializes them, and
structured results come back. No agent ever sees a "UBT is already running" error — they just wait their turn.

**2. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` needs an actual safety boundary.**
Autonomous agents need `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to work unattended, but running that on your host machine with
your full filesystem, credentials, and network is asking for trouble. Docker containers provide that boundary. The agent
gets exactly what it needs (a repo clone, the coordination server endpoint, mounted read-only plugins) and nothing it
doesn't (no host filesystem, no credentials beyond Claude auth, no direct network access to your other services). You
get full autonomy without the risk.

## What this is

A scaffold for handing off implementation work to autonomous Claude Code agents running in Docker containers. Designed
for UE developers who already use Claude Code interactively and want to delegate longer tasks.

Unreal Engine builds require the real engine installation on the host — you cannot install UE inside a container. The
coordination server bridges that gap: containers do the coding, the host does the building, and a message board keeps
everything inspectable.

**The workflow:**

1. Design your plan interactively with Claude Code (human in the loop)
2. Commit the plan as a markdown document
3. Launch a container agent — it executes the plan E2E
4. Each phase builds, passes code review, and commits with a debrief audit trail
5. Monitor progress via the coordination server's message board or the dashboard UI

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.25+
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Docker Compose v2 (or the standalone `docker-compose` v1.29+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) (JSON processor — used by all scaffold scripts)
- A Claude authentication method:
    - **OAuth** (Claude Pro/Max subscription) — mount your `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
    - **API key** — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- An Unreal Engine installation (for the host-side build system)

**Shell note:** On Windows, use Git Bash or WSL. The launch and setup scripts require a Bash-compatible shell.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ue-claude-scaffold.git
cd ue-claude-scaffold

# 2. Run first-time setup (checks prerequisites, creates config files, installs deps)
./setup.sh

# 3. Edit .env with your authentication credentials

# 4. Edit scaffold.config.json with your project paths.
#    For a single UE project use the legacy top-level fields;
#    for multiple projects use the `projects` map (see Configuration below).

# 5. Start the coordination server
cd server && npm run dev

# 6. In another terminal — launch an agent
./launch.sh

# 7. Monitor progress (terminal or browser)
./status.sh --follow
# Or: cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

## How It Works

### Container Agent Architecture

Each container runs a single Claude Code instance in non-interactive (`-p`) mode with a delegated agent type (default:
`container-orchestrator`). The orchestrator:

1. Reads the plan from the task prompt
2. Resolves sub-agents from the project's CLAUDE.md role mapping
3. Delegates each phase to an **implementer** -> verifies build -> delegates to **reviewer**
4. Iterates on failures (max 5 build retries, max 5 review cycles per phase)
5. Commits each phase with a debrief audit document

### Build/Test Routing

Containers don't have Unreal Engine installed. When Claude runs a build or test command, a PreToolUse hook intercepts
it:

1. Commits and pushes current changes to a bare repo
2. Calls the coordination server's `/build` or `/test` endpoint
3. The server syncs changes to a host-side worktree and runs the real build
4. Returns structured output back to the container agent

### Coordination Server

A Fastify + TypeScript server running on the host. Persists state in Postgres via Drizzle ORM — Supabase when `SCAFFOLD_DATABASE_URL` is set, otherwise an in-process PGlite at `server/data/pglite`. Provides:

- **Build/test proxy** -- routes container build requests to the host UE installation
- **Message board** -- pub/sub for agent progress reporting
- **Rooms & teams** -- threaded message rooms and design-team registration
- **Agent registry** -- tracks active agents and their status
- **Project registry** -- portable per-project config (`GET/POST /projects`) backed by the `projects` table
- **UBT lock** -- serializes build tool access with priority queue (multi-agent support)
- **Build history** -- queryable record of all builds with duration and outcome
- **Task queue** -- claim/complete/fail/release/replan lifecycle for worker-mode containers
- **File ownership** -- tracks which agent owns which files during task execution
- **Search** -- full-text search across tasks, messages, and agents
- **Coalesce** -- system-wide coordination for graceful shutdown (pause pumps, release files)
- **Multi-tenancy** -- one server serves multiple UE projects. Requests scope by `X-Project-Id` header (default `default`); every persisted row carries a `project_id`
- **Agent definition compiler** -- `GET /agents/definitions/:type` compiles dynamic-agents on demand and returns the flattened markdown plus its referenced sub-agents in one round-trip; every `dynamic-agents/*.md` is also probed at startup so broken compositions surface immediately

### Git Data Flow

```
Host Project (exterior repo) --> POST /sync/plans --> [bare repo per project] <-- Container (clone/push)
                                                              |
                            docker/{project-id}/current-root  <-- seed branch; synced from exterior repo
                            docker/{project-id}/agent-1       <-- agent-1's working branch
                            docker/{project-id}/agent-2       <-- agent-2's working branch
                                                              |
                            Server fetches agent branch --> Staging Worktree --> Build/Test
```

Each configured project gets its own bare repo and its own set of `docker/{project-id}/*` branches. The container
clones its agent branch on startup and pushes back when a build is requested. The server then fetches those changes
into a staging worktree on the host where the real UE build tools run. `{project-id}` is the scoping key shared by
config, DB rows, git branches, and the `X-Project-Id` HTTP header.

## Configuration

### `.env`

Secrets and per-launch parameters. Created from `.env.example` by `setup.sh`. Structural configuration (paths, ports,
build scripts) lives in `scaffold.config.json`.

| Variable                   | Required | Default                  | Description                                |
|----------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`  | Yes*     | —                        | Path to `.credentials.json` for OAuth auth |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`        | Yes*     | —                        | API key for token-based auth               |
| `SCAFFOLD_DATABASE_URL`    | No       | (PGlite)                 | Postgres connection string for the coordination server. Set in the shell that runs `npm run dev`. Omit to use the in-process PGlite database. The scaffold deliberately ignores any inherited `DATABASE_URL` to avoid hijack from a co-installed Supabase project |
| `AGENT_NAME`               | No       | `agent-1`                | Agent identifier                           |
| `WORK_BRANCH`              | No       | (computed)               | Git branch for the agent — normally set automatically by launch.sh |
| `AGENT_TYPE`               | Yes      | —                        | Agent definition to load (e.g. `container-orchestrator`, `container-orchestrator-ue`, `scaffold-orchestrator`) |
| `CLAUDE_EFFORT`            | No       | `high`                   | Reasoning effort for the top-level Claude session: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Resolution order: launch CLI > scaffold.config.json > .env > built-in default |
| `MAX_TURNS`                | No       | `200`                    | Max Claude Code turns before stopping      |
| `WORKER_MODE`              | No       | `false`                  | Run as task-queue worker instead of plan executor |
| `WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL`     | No       | `30`                     | Worker polling interval in seconds         |
| `WORKER_SINGLE_TASK`       | No       | `true`                   | Worker exits after one task instead of looping |

*One of `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required.

### `scaffold.config.json`

Structural configuration. Created from `scaffold.config.example.json` by `setup.sh`.

**Single-project vs multi-project.** The file accepts either the legacy shape (top-level `project`/`engine`/`build`/`server` fields) or a multi-project shape:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-ue-game": {
      "name": "MyUEGame",
      "path": "D:\\Projects\\MyUEGame",
      "uprojectFile": "MyUEGame.uproject",
      "bareRepoPath": "D:\\Repos\\my-ue-game.git",
      "seedBranch": "docker/my-ue-game/current-root",
      "engine":  { "path": "C:\\UE_5.7", "version": "5.7" },
      "build":   { "scriptPath": "Scripts/build.py", "testScriptPath": "Scripts/run_tests.py" },
      "plugins": { "stagingCopies": [] },
      "stagingWorktreeRoot": "D:\\Staging\\my-ue-game"
    }
  }
}
```

When a `projects` block is present it takes precedence over the legacy top-level fields. Legacy single-project configs are treated internally as a single project named `default`. See `scaffold.config.example.json` for a complete working example showing both shapes side by side.

| Field                        | Description                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `projects`                   | Optional map of project ID -> per-project config. When present, takes precedence over the legacy top-level fields |
| `projects.<id>.agentType`    | Default agent definition for containers launched against this project (e.g. `container-orchestrator-ue`, `scaffold-orchestrator`). Overridden by `--agent-type` on the launch CLI |
| `project.name`               | Your UE project name                          |
| `project.path`               | Absolute path to the project                  |
| `project.uprojectFile`       | The `.uproject` filename                      |
| `engine.path`                | Absolute path to the UE engine                |
| `engine.version`             | UE version string (e.g. `"5.7"`)              |
| `build.scriptPath`           | Build script path relative to project root    |
| `build.testScriptPath`       | Test script path relative to project root     |
| `build.defaultTestFilters`   | Array of default test filter strings          |
| `build.buildTimeoutMs`       | Per-build timeout in ms (default `660000`)    |
| `build.testTimeoutMs`        | Per-test timeout in ms (default `700000`)     |
| `build.ubtRetryCount`        | UBT lock acquisition retries (default `5`)    |
| `build.ubtRetryDelayMs`      | Delay between UBT retries in ms (default `30000`) |
| `plugins.stagingCopies`      | Plugin sources to copy into the staging worktree (`{source, relativeDest}` pairs) |
| `hooks.buildIntercept`       | Per-project toggle for the build/test intercept hook |
| `hooks.cppLint`              | Per-project toggle for the C++ diff linter hook |
| `container.agentType`        | Default agent type for containers             |
| `container.maxTurns`         | Max turns for the agent                       |
| `container.seedBranch`       | Optional override for the seed branch. Default is `docker/{project-id}/current-root`, computed by `server/src/branch-naming.ts` |
| `tasks.seedBranch`           | Legacy single-project seed branch override. For multi-project configs, set `seedBranch` inside each entry of the `projects` map |
| `server.port`                | Coordination server port                      |
| `server.ubtLockTimeoutMs`    | Timeout for UBT lock acquisition              |
| `server.stagingWorktreeRoot` | Path to the host-side staging worktree        |
| `server.bareRepoPath`        | Path to the bare repo                         |

## Scripts

### `launch.sh`

Parameterized launcher for container agents.

```bash
# Launch an agent (tasks come from the task queue)
./launch.sh

# Explicit agent name
./launch.sh --agent-name agent-2

# Override which agent definition to load
./launch.sh --agent-type container-implementer

# Select which configured project to launch against
./launch.sh --project my-ue-game

# Reset the agent branch to docker/{project-id}/current-root before launch
./launch.sh --fresh

# Single-task worker mode (claim one task and exit)
./launch.sh --worker

# Continuous pump mode (keep claiming tasks until drained)
./launch.sh --pump

# Run N pump containers in parallel
./launch.sh --pump --parallel 4

# Launch into a design team with a brief
./launch.sh --team inventory-ui --brief briefs/inventory-ui.md

# One-shot prompt (no task queue)
./launch.sh --prompt "Audit the Inventory module for unused includes"

# Override reasoning effort for the top-level session
./launch.sh --effort xhigh   # low | medium | high | xhigh | max

# Adjust message-board verbosity
./launch.sh --verbosity verbose   # quiet | normal | verbose

# Toggle hooks at launch
./launch.sh --hooks      # Force-enable build intercept + C++/JS linting
./launch.sh --no-hooks   # Force-disable all

# Skip agent registration (debugging / manual runs)
./launch.sh --no-agent

# Preview what would happen without launching
./launch.sh --dry-run

# Full usage
./launch.sh --help
```

If only one project is configured, `--project` can be omitted.

### `setup.sh`

First-time setup. Checks prerequisites, creates configuration files, installs server dependencies.

```bash
# Interactive setup (prompts for optional steps)
./setup.sh

# CI / scripted setup (skips prompts)
./setup.sh --non-interactive
```

In multi-project mode `setup.sh` walks every entry in `projects` and creates a bare repo for each.

### `stop.sh`

Stop running agent containers.

```bash
# Stop all agent containers
./stop.sh

# Stop a specific agent
./stop.sh --agent agent-1

# Stop only containers belonging to a specific project
./stop.sh --project my-ue-game

# Stop all containers in a specific design team
./stop.sh --team inventory-ui

# Graceful drain — pause pumps, wait for in-flight tasks, stop containers
./stop.sh --drain

# Drain with custom timeout (default 600s)
./stop.sh --drain --timeout 300
```

### `status.sh`

Monitoring dashboard. Shows registered agents and message board activity.

```bash
# One-shot status check
./status.sh

# Continuous monitoring (refreshes every 5s)
./status.sh --follow

# Custom refresh interval (10s)
./status.sh --follow 10

# Only show messages after a specific ID
./status.sh --since 42

# Filter agents and messages to a specific project
./status.sh --project my-ue-game
```

Requires `curl` and `jq`. Supports `NO_COLOR` environment variable to disable color output.

## Agent Definitions

There are two parallel definition trees:

- **`agents/`** — static, hand-authored fallback set. Plain markdown with no skills composition. Use these for interactive Claude Code by copying them to your user config: `cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/`.
- **`dynamic-agents/`** — skills-composed definitions that are the active set used in containers. Each `.md` declares a `skills:` list in its front matter; the compiler in `server/src/agent-compiler.ts` (CLI binary `compile-agent`) inlines those skills and writes a flattened pair (`<name>.md` + `<name>.meta.json`) to `.compiled-agents/`. The launcher compiles automatically before container start. The coordination server probes every dynamic agent at startup and logs any compile failures.

### Available Agent Types

#### `agents/` (static fallback set)

| Type                                | Description                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `container-orchestrator`            | Default. Executes a pre-authored plan E2E — delegates to sub-agents, no human approval gates.                            |
| `container-implementer`             | Writes code according to a plan or fix instructions. Builds after each change and iterates until clean.                  |
| `container-reviewer`                | Generic reviewer for spec and project style. Uses confidence scoring to minimize false positives.                        |
| `container-decomposition-reviewer`  | Reviews decomposition criteria including lifetime/safety considerations.                                                 |
| `container-safety-reviewer`         | Focused review of memory safety, thread safety, and invariant preservation.                                              |
| `container-style-reviewer`          | Focused review of style and coding conventions.                                                                          |
| `container-tester`                  | Writes tests for an implementation, runs them, and iterates until passing.                                               |
| `changeling`                        | Adaptive role used in design discussions; placeholder participant.                                                       |

#### `dynamic-agents/` (skills-composed; active set)

Per-stack orchestrators (`container-orchestrator-ue`, `scaffold-orchestrator`, `scaffold-server-orchestrator`, `scaffold-dashboard-orchestrator`, `content-catalogue-dashboard-orchestrator`), implementers (`container-implementer-ue`, `scaffold-implementer`, `scaffold-server-implementer`, `scaffold-dashboard-implementer`), role-specialised reviewers (decomposition / safety / correctness / react-quality / browser-safety / typescript-type) per stack, style-sweep agents (`container-style-sweep-ue`, `scaffold-style-sweep`, `scaffold-server-style-sweep`), and the design-team roster (`design-leader`, `design-architect`, `design-domain`, `design-data`, `design-ui`, `design-ui-mantine`, `design-elegance`, `design-performance`, `design-safety`, `design-critic`, `cleanup-leader`).

Add an `### Orchestrator Role Mapping` section to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
### Orchestrator Role Mapping

| Role          | Agent              | Notes                          |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `reviewer`    | `my-code-reviewer` | Project-specific review rules  |
| `implementer` | (default)          |                                |
```

### Writing a Plan Document

Plan documents are markdown files that describe the implementation work for an agent. See `tasks/example-prompt.md` for
the expected format. Key guidelines:

- Break the work into numbered phases
- Each phase should be independently buildable and reviewable
- Include acceptance criteria the agent can verify
- Reference specific files and paths where possible

## Troubleshooting

**Server unreachable when launching**
The coordination server must be running before you launch an agent. Start it with `cd server && npm run dev` and verify
with `curl http://localhost:9100/health`.

**Shell scripts fail on Windows**
The scripts require a Bash-compatible shell. Use Git Bash (included with Git for Windows) or WSL. The `.gitattributes`
file ensures scripts keep LF line endings.

**Docker Compose not found**
Install Docker Desktop (includes Compose v2) or install the standalone `docker-compose`. The scripts detect both
`docker compose` (plugin) and `docker-compose` (standalone).

**"BARE_REPO_PATH is not set" or similar**
Edit your `scaffold.config.json` file and set all required paths. Run `./launch.sh --dry-run` to verify your
configuration.

**Build timeouts**
The default UBT lock timeout is 600000ms (10 minutes). For large projects, increase `server.ubtLockTimeoutMs` in
`scaffold.config.json`.

**Agent seems stuck**
Check container logs: `docker compose --project-name claude-<agent-name> -f container/docker-compose.yml logs -f`. The
agent has a `MAX_TURNS` limit (default 200) after which it will stop.

**Port conflict on 9100**
Change `server.port` in `scaffold.config.json` and restart the server.

**Agent lands on the wrong project / empty task queue**
Confirm `--project <id>` matches a key in `scaffold.config.json` -> `projects`. Without `--project`, the scripts fall back to the sole configured project, which only works when exactly one is defined.

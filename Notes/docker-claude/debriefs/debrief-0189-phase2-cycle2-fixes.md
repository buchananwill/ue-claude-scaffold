# Debrief 0189 — Phase 2 cycle 2: server sessions route review fixes

## Task Summary

Address blocking and warning findings from two reviewers on the Phase 2
sessions route work (commit 87721a1). Fixes are committed in a single
batch covering correctness, safety, and registration plumbing.

Plan source: `Notes/container-session-token-tracking/phase-2-server-sessions-route.md`.

## Cycle 2 fixes

### B1 — `resolveProject` is never called

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts`: added `import type { ScaffoldConfig } from '../config.js'` and `import { resolveProject } from '../resolve-project.js'`. Defined `interface PluginOpts { config: ScaffoldConfig }` and changed the plugin signature to `FastifyPluginAsync<PluginOpts>`, destructuring `{ config }` in the body. At the top of all three handlers (POST /sessions, PATCH /sessions/:id, GET /sessions), the route now calls `await resolveProject(config, db, projectId)` inside a try/catch and replies `reply.notFound("Unknown project: '<id>'")` if it throws.
- `server/src/index.ts:101`: registration updated from `await server.register(sessionsPlugin)` to `await server.register(sessionsPlugin, { config })`.
- The reviewer note used the type name `ResolvedConfig`; this codebase uses `ScaffoldConfig` (verified via `Grep` — `ResolvedConfig` is not defined anywhere). Adopted `ScaffoldConfig` to match `tasks.ts` / `build.ts` / `agents.ts`. This is a code-sample-to-style adaptation; behaviour (project resolution + 404 on unknown project) is delivered.

### B2 — server-stamp guard had an extra `current.endedAt === null` clause

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts`: replaced the guard at the previously-flagged location. The new guard is unconditional on the row's existing endedAt:
  ```ts
  if (
    body.status !== undefined &&
    TERMINAL_STATUSES.has(body.status) &&
    body.endedAt === undefined
  ) {
    update.endedAt = new Date();
  }
  ```
  Note this also tightens the trigger to `body.status` (not `update.status`), which is identical in current code (no path in the route mutates `update.status` after the validate block) but reads more directly against the spec.
- The previous guard stopped re-stamping when the row was already terminal; now any patch that sets a terminal `body.status` without supplying `body.endedAt` re-stamps. This is the spec's literal rule.
- New test `PATCH /sessions/:id re-stamps endedAt on terminal-to-terminal transition without endedAt` (sessions.test.ts) plants a 5-min-old `startedAt` + 3-min-old `endedAt` via direct DB insert (so I can prove the re-stamp without timing fragility), then PATCHes `status: 'aborted'` with no `endedAt`, and asserts the new stamp is strictly later than the planted one and within 1 second of "now".

### B3 — `getByIdInProject` accepted soft-deleted agents

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts`: in the POST handler, after the existence check, added `if (agent.status === 'deleted') return reply.code(400).send({ error: 'invalid_agentId' });`. This is an inline guard scoped to the route — `queries/agents.ts` is intentionally not touched (per the file-ownership scope and the reviewer's note that an inline guard is the right shape).
- New test `POST /sessions rejects a soft-deleted agent` (sessions.test.ts) directly updates `agents.status = 'deleted'` for `agent1Id` and POSTs a session; asserts 400/404 with `error: 'invalid_agentId'`.

### Safety W1 — `rawOutput` jsonb size bound

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts`: added `const RAW_OUTPUT_MAX_BYTES = 64 * 1024` and a check before assigning `update.rawOutput`:
  ```ts
  const serialised = JSON.stringify(body.rawOutput);
  if (serialised.length > RAW_OUTPUT_MAX_BYTES) {
    return reply.code(400).send({ error: 'rawOutput_too_large' });
  }
  ```
  String-length is bytes-of-UTF-16 in the V8 sense, but for ASCII-dominant Claude `result` payloads it is a correct byte-equivalent ceiling and well under the 1 MiB the reviewer was worried about.
- New test `PATCH /sessions/:id rejects rawOutput payloads that exceed the 64 KiB cap` (sessions.test.ts) sends `{ blob: 'x'.repeat(70 * 1024) }` and asserts 400 with `error: 'rawOutput_too_large'`.

### Safety W3 — `endedAt` range checks

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts`: after parsing `endedAt`, added two range checks:
  - Reject `400 invalid_endedAt` if `parsed.getTime() > Date.now() + 5_000` (named constant `ENDED_AT_FUTURE_TOLERANCE_MS`).
  - Reject `400 invalid_endedAt` if `current.startedAt && parsed < current.startedAt`. The null-guard is defensive; in practice `startedAt` is `NOT NULL` in the schema and stamped by the server at POST.
- New tests:
  - `PATCH /sessions/:id rejects an endedAt more than 5s in the future` posts `endedAt = now + 1h` and asserts 400.
  - `PATCH /sessions/:id rejects an endedAt earlier than startedAt` posts `endedAt = '2000-01-01'` and asserts 400.

### Test infra adjustments to keep existing assertions valid

- `server/src/routes/sessions.test.ts`: added a `makeConfig()` helper that extends `createTestConfig()` with a `proj-a` entry in `resolvedProjects`, and a `projects` table insert for `proj-a` so the FK on `agents`/`sessions` is satisfied. Without this, `resolveProject('proj-a')` would 404 on every cross-project assertion, which would have masked or mis-interpreted the project-scoping tests.
- Pre-existing PATCH-update test was using `endedAt = Date.now() - 1000`, which was earlier than the row's `startedAt` (created milliseconds before in the same test) and would now be rejected by the new W3 range check. Switched to `endedAt = new Date().toISOString()` — within the future-tolerance window and after `startedAt`.
- The cross-project GET test originally pointed `idOther` at `agent1Id` (a default-project agent), which would violate FK if/when we tightened things. Switched to a freshly-registered `agent-pa` in `proj-a` so the row is internally consistent.
- New test `POST /sessions returns 404 when X-Project-Id is unknown` covers the unknown-project path explicitly (B1's positive path).

### Correctness W1 (registration plumbing)

- Already covered above under B1: `server/src/index.ts:101` updated to `await server.register(sessionsPlugin, { config })`.

### Correctness W3 (informational, no source change)

- The reviewer flagged terminal-to-terminal transitions as a concern; the plan only blocks `→ running`. Once B2 was fixed, the `complete → aborted` re-patch correctly re-stamps `endedAt`, which is precisely what the warning was asking for. No additional guard added.

## Files touched

- `server/src/routes/sessions.ts` — modified (B1, B2, B3, W1 safety, W3 safety).
- `server/src/routes/sessions.test.ts` — modified (multi-project test config, FK seed for `proj-a`, fixed pre-existing PATCH-update test's `endedAt`, fixed cross-project GET test's agent ref, added 6 new tests).
- `server/src/index.ts` — modified (sessions plugin registration takes `{ config }`).
- `Notes/docker-claude/debriefs/debrief-0189-phase2-cycle2-fixes.md` — new (this file).

## Build & Test Results

- `cd server && npm run typecheck` — PASS (exit 0, no output).
- `cd server && npx tsx --test src/routes/sessions.test.ts` — PASS, 14 tests in the file (8 from cycle 1 plus 6 new ones).
- `cd server && npm test` — PASS, **644 tests across 84 suites, 0 failures**. Test count delta: +6 vs. cycle 1's 638. No pre-existing tests regressed.

## Open Questions / Risks

- The `rawOutput` size check uses `JSON.stringify().length`. For non-ASCII payloads, UTF-16 char count > UTF-8 byte count, so the effective limit is slightly stricter than 64 KiB-of-UTF-8. This is the more conservative direction and acceptable for the `result` event payloads we expect.
- The `endedAt < startedAt` check trusts `current.startedAt`. If a future code path ever inserts a session with `startedAt = NULL`, the check is silently skipped. The schema's `NOT NULL` constraint backstops this.
- `resolveProject` is now called on GET as well as POST/PATCH. This adds one DB round-trip per GET request to validate the project. The cost is small (single-row primary-key lookup) and matches the pattern in other project-scoped routes.

## Suggested Follow-ups

- Update the shared `server/src/queries/test-utils.ts` SCHEMA_DDL to include `claude_code_container_sessions` so other test files don't need the inline `CREATE TABLE`. (Carried over from cycle 1.)
- Consider extracting a shared `validateAgentForProject(db, projectId, agentId, { allowDeleted: false })` helper if a third call site appears that needs the same not-found-OR-deleted gate.
- Phase 3's container-side capture should explicitly omit `endedAt` from its PATCH payload so the server-side stamp path is exercised end-to-end.

## Decomposition cycle 1

### W1 — `resolveProject` try/catch dedup

The same 5-line try/catch appeared in all three handlers (POST, PATCH, GET). Extracted a private `ensureProject` helper at the top of `sessions.ts` (above `formatSession`):

```ts
async function ensureProject(
  config: ScaffoldConfig,
  db: DrizzleDb,
  projectId: string,
  reply: FastifyReply,
): Promise<boolean>
```

Returns `true` on success; on failure sends `reply.notFound("Unknown project: '<id>'")` (via `void reply.notFound(...)`) and returns `false`. Each handler's project-resolution block is now a single line:

```ts
if (!(await ensureProject(config, db, projectId, reply))) return;
```

Behaviour preserved: the 404 reply is still dispatched on unknown project (verified by the existing `POST /sessions returns 404 when X-Project-Id is unknown` test, which still passes). Type choices match the rest of the codebase: `DrizzleDb` from `drizzle-instance.ts` (matches `resolveProject`'s `db` parameter exactly), `ScaffoldConfig` from `config.js`, `FastifyReply` from `fastify`. Imports updated to bring in `FastifyReply` and `DrizzleDb`.

Line counts: `sessions.ts` went from 322 to 330 lines (+8 net — helper added, three try/catch blocks each shrank from 5 lines to 1).

### W2 — Add the four missing indexes to inline test DDL

The inline `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS claude_code_container_sessions ...` in `sessions.test.ts` (~lines 37-54) did not include the four indexes from migration `0006_add_container_sessions.sql`. Added them as four separate `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` statements via `ctx.db.execute(sql`...`)` immediately after the table creation:

- `idx_ccs_project` ON `(project_id)`
- `idx_ccs_agent` ON `(agent_id)`
- `idx_ccs_task` ON `(task_id)`
- `idx_ccs_project_started` ON `(project_id, started_at DESC)`

This restores prod/test parity. Note: PGlite executes them as no-ops for query planning purposes (PGlite is single-process, no real plan caching), but it still validates that the DDL is syntactically accepted, which guards against future drift between migration syntax and PGlite's parser. The tests pass identically.

### Scope-related follow-up not addressed in this cycle

The decomposition reviewer's broader fix — moving the entire `claude_code_container_sessions` DDL (table + indexes + comment) into the shared `server/src/queries/test-utils.ts` SCHEMA_DDL block — was **out of scope** for this cycle's file ownership (Phase 2 owns `routes/sessions.ts` and `routes/sessions.test.ts` only; `queries/test-utils.ts` is owned elsewhere). Recorded as a separate suggested follow-up above (already present from cycle 1, reaffirmed here). The inline DDL with explicit indexes is the correct interim shape.

### Build & Test Results (decomposition cycle 1)

- `cd server && npm run typecheck` — PASS (exit 0, no output).
- `cd server && npx tsx --test src/routes/sessions.test.ts` — PASS, 14/14 tests.
- `cd server && npm test` — PASS, **644 tests across 84 suites, 0 failures**. No regressions.
